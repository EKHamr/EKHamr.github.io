        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Andrew Lewis, I go by Drew, ever since i was a little kid I was into anything that I could take apart, this included legos, computers, and any unfortunate toy i got bored of. I went to Borden where i did kindergarten thorugh 12th grade. I gratuated 7th in my class of 43, I took all of the dual credit and AP classes that they had offered there, I went on to the UNiversity of Louisville where I started out as a Pre-Med student. I had a really rough time converting to the big classes and the Universirt in general, towards the end of my first semester I started to realize that Biology and Medicine were not my thing, I never even showed much interest in them growing up it was just something that my parents pushed me into. I took a week of my two week break to sit down and decide what I wanted to do, drop out or change majors, I decided to change my major. I told my parents what I wanted to do, and then my grandparents and friends. My Grandma was the one who brought up Engineering, no one in my family has done engineering in fact my dad is the only one to graduate college, he has a masters in nursing. It was a big step to change to Mechanical Engineering, but I haven't been happier since I submitted that major change form. My biggest hobby is cars, I love everything about them, from working on them, to driving them, and especially learning about them. I never liked learning in school and a few of my teachers could vouche for that, but when it comes to learning about engines, transmissions, differentials, suspension geometries, aerodynamics, etc, its like I get tunnel vission and I'm instantly locked in. This is why I believe that I'd make an excellent Mechanical Engineer, I'm very meticulous when it comes to working on anything, proof can be found under my projects tab.</p>
